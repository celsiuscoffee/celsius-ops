# STATE — cross-session memory

Working memory for agent sessions on this repo. Read this at the start of every
session; update it before ending one. Keep entries dated, terse, and factual —
delete entries that have been promoted into `CLAUDE.md`, a skill, or a doc.

## Verified facts

- 2026-07-04 — `apps/pos-native` and `apps/pickup-native` sit **outside** the npm
  workspace (own `package-lock.json` each); root `npm ci` does not install them.
- 2026-07-04 — Two migration directories exist: `packages/db/prisma/migrations/`
  (the audit trail CI's migration-guard checks — files are saved, never executed)
  and `supabase/migrations/` (018–070, applied history). Schema of record is
  `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`.
- 2026-07-04 — `.claude/launch.json` is partially stale: `inventory`, `loyalty`,
  and `pos` entries point at `apps/` directories that no longer exist.
- 2026-07-04 — Procurement loop: automated PO-send to suppliers over WhatsApp
  (`purchase_order` / `po_approval` buttons) was designed but **never shipped**;
  sending the order block is still manual. Agent only needs an open PO to exist.
  (Source: `docs/design/procurement-e2e-test-runbook.md`.)
- 2026-07-04 — Stock accuracy is shadow-only (consumption engine off); reorder
  runs off receipts − wastage/transfers, not sales. Going live needs unit
  normalisation + recipe import (`docs/design/procurement-qa-2026-06-26.md`).
- 2026-07-05 — RLS coverage is broader than `docs/rls-strategy.md` claims
  (three later migration sets added deny-all/policied RLS to HR, bank, ads,
  and all `fin_*` tables) — but the **loyalty tables' policies are
  `USING (true)` for all roles, so member PII/points are anon-readable AND
  writable**. Full verified map + ranked fixes:
  `docs/rls-access-map-2026-07-05.md`.
- 2026-07-04 — 14 Vercel crons fail silently into logs (no heartbeat
  monitoring wired yet). `reconcile-pending` (order, every 1 min) is the
  payments-critical one. See `docs/monitoring-setup.md`.
- 2026-07-04 — Exception-inbox corrections update `fin_agent_decisions`
  (`corrected=true, corrected_to=…`) — this is the finance agents' eval/
  retraining dataset. Preserve the write path in any refactor.
- 2026-07-05 — Categorizer runs on `claude-haiku-4-5` with a prompt-cached
  COA block; its vendor context is the last **5** bills, not the 50 the
  spec describes (spec drift, `categorizer.ts` `supplierHistory()`).
- 2026-07-05 — The Anomaly agent from the finance spec is **not built**;
  matching is rules-based (`ap-match.ts`) + an LLM verifier — nothing
  writes `fin_matches`. Only `ap`/`categorization` exceptions have a
  resolver; other exception types noop on resolve.

- 2026-07-05 — **Revenue is split across 3 tables** and reconciles to the
  manpower workbook to the ringgit: `storehub_sales` (per-outlet retirement
  Jun 15–17), `pos_orders` (in-house POS from Jun 8/15/18, GrabFood
  included), `orders` (pickup app). Any revenue query must UNION all three
  while the cutover is in a trailing window (`lib/hr/labour-gate.ts`
  `revenueBetween`).
- 2026-07-05 — **PT wages never flow through payroll runs** (Apr+): they are
  weekly bank transfers → `BankStatementLine` (`partimer` rule) → GL
  `6500-03`. June per outlet: Con 5,103 / SA 9,168 / Tam 6,078 / Nilai
  3,892. Outlet venue prefixes exist in descriptions since June; classifier
  fixed + 266 rows backfilled (migration 071).
- 2026-07-05 — All six 2026 monthly payroll runs are status `draft` (no
  OT/allowances finalised) — FT actuals read ~RM3k/outlet flattering vs the
  workbook until closed.
- 2026-07-05 — 4 scheduled staff have no `hr_employee_profiles` row
  (Hidayat, Irfan, a 2nd Haziq — Putrajaya; Fatin — Tamarind). The labour
  gate blocks publishes that include them until profiles+rates exist.
- 2026-07-05 — Shift templates of record are the `hr_shift_templates` DB
  rows (Opening / Middle 1–3 / Closing per outlet); `lib/hr/shift-templates.ts`
  is only the fallback when the table is empty.

## General rules

- Typecheck before pushing — every time. CI enforces it, but catch it locally.
- Never test against the production database; the procurement runbook's seed SQL
  is staging-only.
- When a fix is confirmed working, record *why it worked* here or in the relevant
  skill — not just in the chat.

## Open failures

- 2026-07-05 — **`pos_*` + `orders`: 14 `USING(true)` policies are BY
  DESIGN** (SUNMI tills write via the anon key). Do NOT lint-fix — needs a
  data-layer plan (rls-strategy.md Path A). 4 `security_definer_view` +
  ~12 `function_search_path_mutable` remain as low-risk hardening.
- 2026-07-05 — 13 of 14 Vercel crons still have no heartbeat monitoring
  (`reconcile-pending` wired 2026-07-05; the rest fail silently).
- 2026-07-05 — Pickup dashboard **inventory tab reads tables that don't
  exist** (`ingredients`, `stock_levels`, `ingredient_outlet_settings` —
  absent from BOTH Supabase projects); it has been silently empty. Either
  wire it to the real procurement stock tables (`StockBalance` etc.) or
  remove the tab.

_Resolved 2026-07-05 evening (see Lessons + access-map correction): the
"loyalty tables anon-writable" finding was already fixed in production —
live DB had drifted ahead of repo migration files. Actual live exposure
was the `outlets` view (anon DML, RLS bypass); revoked same day
(supabase/migrations/073, applied via Supabase MCP, verified). Full
get_advisors sweep then closed ALL remaining anon-reachable tables:
10 backup snapshots (074) + 14 server-only tables incl. PendingPop/grab_*
(075). Verified: rls_disabled_in_public 24→0, sensitive_columns_exposed
2→0, security ERRORs 30→4 (the 4 left are SECURITY DEFINER views)._

_Fixed 2026-07-05 (see Lessons): categorizer correction mis-attribution +
never-set `applied` flag — `related_id` now populated at decision time,
corrections join decisionId → document → supplier, `applied` set on
auto-post and inbox approve._

_Format: `YYYY-MM-DD — <symptom> — <evidence> — <hypothesis/fix> — <blocking?>`_

## Lessons learned

- 2026-07-04 — `eas update` shells out to `expo export`, whose interactive
  prompts ignore `--non-interactive`; set `CI=1` in the environment instead.
  Pass commit messages via env var, not inline in the shell command (backticks/

- 2026-07-05 — The AI Fill week-wipe (60 shifts) was the old generator's
  DELETE-then-INSERT persist with no transaction; `hr_schedule_shift_audit`
  (migration 070) held every deleted row and `jsonb_populate_record` restored
  them losslessly. Replace-style writers must delete+insert in ONE
  transaction, and the delete-audit pattern pays for itself.

## Resume pointer

- 2026-07-06 — **Checklist auto-assign: data-driven FOH/BOH station** (PR #824,
  branch `claude/auto-assign-checklist-hqqzfd`, draft — NOT yet merged). Root
  cause of "auto-assign didn't assign the attended person": station came from a
  hardcoded title map in `ops-nudges` that mis-classed *Ice Machine Cleaning* as
  kitchen (it's at the bar → FOH). Now data-driven both sides: `Sop.stations`
  (enum `SopStation{foh,boh,lead,shared}`, **array/multi-select** — a SOP can be
  FOH+BOH or shared) + `hr_employee_profiles.station` (text, nullable = infer
  from position). Auto-assign pools anyone matching ANY of the SOP's areas
  (`matchesAnyStation`); explicit employee station overrides position;
  `STATION_POSITIONS` foh←barista/cashier, boh←kitchen. UI: multi-select on SOP
  create+detail pages; FOH/BOH/lead selector on the employee Employment card.
  **Both migrations APPLIED to prod + verified 2026-07-06** (`sop_station`,
  `hr_profile_station`); today's 3 ice-machine rows repointed to FOH baristas.
  **Still open:** merge+deploy PR #824 so the new routing runs (until then the
  OLD armed cron/JIT still uses the kitchen map — the old JIT could re-own
  tonight's ice machine to kitchen only if the FOH assignee never clocks in).

- 2026-07-05 — **Staff access-control audit + hotfixes** (`docs/staff-access-
  audit-2026-07-05.md`). Application-layer RBAC audit across POS login, staff
  app, checklists, stock count, receiving, own audit/performance, backoffice,
  and the cross-app identity layer. Root cause: enforcement copy-pasted inline
  into ~470 routes, 3 divergent `getSession`/`requireRole` impls, client-only
  module/UI gates. Much was fixed in parallel: #697 (order `/api/staff/*` +
  staff dashboard/products/settings auth), #802 (anon RLS surface 24→0), #799
  (vitest `@/` alias). This session added: **decommission** of the retired
  order `/staff/*` web surface + dead feed routes (kept `staff-token.ts` +
  `/api/orders/[orderId]/status`, load-bearing for pickup-native collect), and
  **staff hotfixes** (audit `[id]` read/write scoping, `transfers/[id]`
  outlet check, `switch-outlet` outletIds, dashboard outlet-pin). **Still
  open:** C-2 (POS `verify-manager` PIN oracle, OTA-coupled), H-1 (backoffice
  `ops/audit-*` reachable by STAFF cross-app token — wrong `getSession`
  import), H-4 (MANAGER over-reach across ~150 `requireAuth`-only backoffice
  routes), H-5 (session revocation unwired), M-1 (`CUSTOMER_JWT_SECRET`
  fallback). Durable fix = the `withAuth({roles,module,scope})` guard + CI
  check in §5 of the doc (not yet built).

- 2026-07-05 — **Ads + local-rank loop hardened** (PRs #732/#751/#781/#783/#797
  all merged): budget-cut optimizer live at `/ads/optimizer` (waste tier +
  efficiency trims vs fleet-best cost/conv, `ads_budget_change` ledger applied
  to prod, approval-gated, weekly shadow inside `ads-daily` Mondays); keyword
  strategy board at `/reviews/geogrid/keywords` (own/focus/prominence/retire,
  opportunity-sorted). **Measurement bugs fixed:** `ads_campaign.status` stores
  Google's numeric enum ("2"=ENABLED) — filter with `ENABLED_STATUSES`; the
  geogrid auto-scan defaulted to 0.2mi (storefront) — now 1.5534mi = the ±10km
  catchment; keyword buckets only trust complete catchment-scale scans (Nilai's
  "owned" verdicts were 0.1mi artifacts). **Tamarind was wired to Shah Alam's
  GBP location** (poisoned snapshots Jul 3–5, deleted from prod; the fake
  160.6/day velocity was the count-jump): `reviews-daily-snapshot` now
  self-heals `gbpLocationName` nightly by matching `gbpPlaceId` (set for all 4
  outlets from verified scan/QR evidence) against `listAccountLocations`;
  on-demand check at `/api/reviews/gbp-relink[?apply=1]`. **Lever validation:**
  categories = strongest rank lever; review velocity ≈20% and the binding
  constraint (Nilai 2/30d, SA ~11, Tam ~17, Putrajaya 34); GBP description is
  NOT a rank factor — stop treating geo-in-description as a rank play.
  **Next:** after the first true-10km scan (Mon Jul 6, 1pm MYT) read fresh
  baselines and propose per-outlet GBP category adds; owner still owes the ads
  search-term backfill curl (CRON_SECRET) and the review-velocity ops push.

- 2026-07-05 — **People-cost gating loop shipped** (PRs #765/#780/#785 all
  merged): labour gate + publish enforcement (green/amber/red, per-outlet
  budgets Con 16/18, SA 18/20, Tam 22/25 interim), editor badge + per-day
  coverage chips, PT bank-line outlet tagging, Monday variance digest
  (`cron/labour-variance`, SHADOW — flip `LABOUR_VARIANCE_MODE=armed` after
  one sane Monday), and a rule-based+agentic AI Fill (DB templates, FT 45h +
  rest days, rovers 2 days/outlet, PT as amber `pt_suggestion` cells inside
  the budget envelope). Design + verification:
  `docs/design/people-cost-gating-loop.md`. Humans owe: profiles for the 4
  orphan staff, finalise 6 draft payroll runs, confirm Tamarind 22/25.

- 2026-07-04 — Harness scaffolding rounds 1+2 done: root `CLAUDE.md`, this
  file, skills `{db-migration,ota-release,procurement-e2e,finance-module,
  sentry-triage}`, workflow `.claude/workflows/rls-audit.js`, and a nightly
  Sentry-triage routine scheduled (05:00 MYT, fresh session per run —
  manage via the Routines/triggers list).
  Next candidates: run the `rls-audit` workflow and act on the report;
  build the finance eval replay (corrected `fin_agent_decisions` rows →
  regression set per agent, see finance-module skill); wire cron heartbeat
  monitors (`docs/monitoring-setup.md` §2).
- 2026-07-05 — Hardening batch shipped: pickup-page reads moved server-side,
  `related_id`/`applied` fixes, `reconcile-pending` Sentry heartbeat,
  `docs/ops-hardening-checklist.md` (human dashboard items + quarterly
  key-rotation calendar reminder on barista@, next 2026-10-01), and the
  loyalty policy-fix proposal in `docs/proposals/`. **Waiting on human:**
  apply the proposal SQL after deploy (checklist §5), `hr_payroll_runs`
  RLS one-liner (§6), IP allowlist (§1), BetterUptime + Vercel→Slack (§3),
  PITR decision (§4). SMS attribution holdout (loop #1) still needs the
  two owner decisions: exact reward + success bar
  (`docs/design/sms-loop-engineering.md`).
